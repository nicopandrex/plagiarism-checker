Statement by the President Announcing the Use of the A-Bomb at Hiroshima

Sixteen hours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base.
That bomb had more power than 20,000 tons of T.N.T. It had more than two thousand times the blast power of
the British Grand Slam, which is the largest bomb ever yet used in the history of warfare.

The Japanese began the war from the air at Pearl Harbor. They have been repaid many fold. And the end is not
yet. With this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the
growing power of our armed forces.

In their present form these bombs are now in production and even more powerful forms are in development.

It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe. The force from which the sun
draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.

We are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have
above ground in any city. We shall destroy their docks, their factories, and their communications.
Let there be no mistake; we shall completely destroy Japan's power to make war.

It was to spare the Japanese people from utter destruction that the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at
Potsdam. Their leaders promptly rejected that ultimatum. If they do not now accept our terms they may
expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.

Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen
and with the fighting skill they are already well aware of.

The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base. That was because
we wished in this first attack to avoid, insofar as possible, the killing of civilians.

But that attack is only a warning of things to come. If Japan does not surrender, bombs will have to be
dropped on her war industries and, unfortunately, thousands of civilian lives will be lost. I urge
Japanese civilians to leave industrial cities immediately and save themselves from destruction.

I shall recommend that the Congress of the United States consider promptly the establishment of an
appropriate commission to control the production and use of atomic power within the United States.

The greatest marvel is not the size of the enterprise, its secrecy, or its cost, but the achievement of
scientific brains in putting together infinitely complex pieces of knowledge held by many men in different
fields of science into a workable plan.

And now we are here, with the first nuclear bomb, and it has been used. We have used it against those who
attacked us without warning at Pearl Harbor, against those who have abandoned the pretense of obeying
international laws of warfare.

We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands
of young Americans. We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy Japan's power to make war.
Only a Japanese surrender will stop us.

Harry S. Truman
President of the United States
