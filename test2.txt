Statement by the President Announcing the Use of the Atomic Bomb at Hiroshima

Sixteen hours ago, an American airplane dropped one bomb on Hiroshima, an important Japanese Army base. That bomb had power greater than 20,000 tons of TNT. It had more than two thousand times the blast power of the British Grand Slam, the largest bomb yet used in the history of warfare.

Japan began this war from the air at Pearl Harbor, and they have been repaid many times over. And the end is not yet. With this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the growing power of our armed forces.

In their present form these bombs are now in production, and even more powerful forms are in development.

This is an atomic bomb. It is the harnessing of the basic power of the universe. The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.

We are now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the Japanese have above ground in any city. We shall destroy their docks, their factories, and their communications. Let there be no mistake: we shall completely destroy Japan’s power to make war.

To spare the Japanese people from utter destruction, the ultimatum of July 26 was issued at Potsdam. Their leaders promptly rejected it. If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.

Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen, and with the fighting skill they are already well aware of.

The world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base. That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid, as far as possible, the killing of civilians.

But that attack is only a warning of things to come. If Japan does not surrender, bombs will have to be dropped on her war industries and, unfortunately, thousands of civilian lives will be lost. I urge Japanese civilians to leave industrial cities immediately and save themselves from destruction.

I shall recommend that the Congress of the United States promptly consider the establishment of an appropriate commission to control the production and use of atomic power within the United States.

The greatest marvel is not the size of the enterprise, its secrecy, or its cost, but the achievement of scientific minds in putting together complex pieces of knowledge held by many men in different fields of science into a workable plan.

And now we are here with the first nuclear bomb, and it has been used. We have used it against those who attacked us without warning at Pearl Harbor, against those who have abandoned any pretense of obeying international laws of warfare.

We have used it to shorten the agony of war and to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans. We shall continue to use it until we completely destroy Japan’s power to make war. Only a Japanese surrender will stop us.

Harry S. Truman
President of the United States
